# "Embedded Systems Development" KPI lab practice. 
### All solutions are written in pure Kotlin.


## How to run:

1. To run labs "Lab-1", "Lab-2" and "Lab-3": 

    1.1. Either build whole root gradle project or selected lab module
 
    1.2. Execute lab in one of described ways:
 
      * Via IDE - run related main() method, located in "Runner.kt" source code file (for all mentioned labs)
        
      * Via Command Line - also by running compiled RunnerKt.class of selected lab module
  
2. To run Android labs ("Lab1a"):

    2.1. Import selected Android lab module as separate gradle (Android) project
 
     2.2. Execute it as regular Android App project (via packed APK, real linked device, emulator, etc.)
